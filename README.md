This is a part of project for CMSC215: Human and Computer Interaction taught by Professor John Doughtery in Spring 2018.
BMCDS aims to provide an easy interface for Bryn Mawr students to see what is being provided in which dining hall. 
It also aims to suggest students what to eat or a tip for a healthy diet.
